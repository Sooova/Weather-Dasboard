# Weather-Dashbord

# Abstract 

My Submission during my time at the Monash Coding Bootcamp, for a web applet that provides weather checking functionality on a city to city basis.

The submission critera was to create a web-applet similiar in design and/or function to:

# Notes 
There were quite a few new concepts or old concepts that i have understood better as a result of completing this applet. I am better able to traverse using the fetch API, and using the debugging tool in dev tools has become second nature as well. 
In hindsight, instead of dynamically creating the elements when displaying the five day forecast, it would have been easier to display them at all times in the HTML. But as a result of creating them dynamically, i have a vastly superior grasp of dynamic element creation using jQuery and vanila javascript. 
I also used a lot more parameters in my functions, so i was able to call the function many more times throughout the code using different parameters, as opposed to having a plain function.

# To Do
The web-applet contains only basic styling, so as to get functionality completed. I plan to come back, and style the website more.
